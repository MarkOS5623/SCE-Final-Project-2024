   Create a new request             |   Title         Author
                                    |   request_1     user_1        [view]
    My requests                     |   request_2     user_2        [view]
                                    |   request_3     user_1        [view]
    My authorization      ->        |


    * When viewing an tuthorizaion request, the editor would be open in read-only mode with the details
      of the authorization
    NOTE: consider how the data would be transported, if the data would be received as an editor file,
    then you have no choice but to open with the editr, 
    However, there's no much point in opening an "editor" for a sign reqsust,
    Alternativelty the data for the sign request can be recevied as a JSON object, and
    you can have a custom component to display and sign.
